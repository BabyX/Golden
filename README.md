# Golden by Baby X

This is the project files for a recording of _Golden_, a song written by [James][] Forbes and arranged by [Baby X][]

They are on Github so [James][] and [Drew][] can tweak the mix and add other layers collaboratively.  But this repo is public.
So if you would like to help us mix, just send a Pull Request :smile:
